1.- INTRODUCTION
---------------------

LibSUNAI is an open-source library of classes to solve some Computer Vision problems in the context of the Scene UNderstanding 
and Artificial Intelligence research group. The main objective is to share the code with students and researchers. You can use this
code under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.

2.- INSTALLING
---------------------

The library does not need to be installed in any special way. Download the last version in ZIP or TAR formats from the main repository
webpage (http://xbaro.github.com/LibSUNAI/) and unzip it whatever you want. You also can clone the project using the following command:

git clone git://github.com/xbaro/LibSUNAI

The library depends on some other libraries, which are referenced in the folder "3rdparty". You need to install the dependencies before to
compile the library. The required dependencies are:

	OpenCV 2.3 (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/)
	CURL (http://curl.haxx.se/download.html)

2.1.- WINDOWS

For Windows systems, you can find a project to use the library and some provided sample projects with Microsoft Visual Studio 10. The solution
file can be found at "_make\MSVC10\LibSUNAI". 
The folder "3rdparty" contains the includes, lib files and DLLs to compile on x86 platforms. These files are linked to the MSVC10 solution, so you can 
just download and compile the project and samples without installing any additional library. The free Microft Visual C++ 2010 Express suite
can be used.

The executables and DLLs resulting of the compilation are copyed to the "bin" folder, while the lib files are copyed to the "lib" folder.
 
 2.2.- LINUX
 
 The library has been tested on Ubuntu 11.10 and 12.04LTS. A project for KDevelop4 based on CMake is available at "_make/KDevelop4/". To be able
 to compile the library and their samples, you need to install the required dependencies. The building script will look for the installation folders and add
 their to the library and samples.
 
 The executables and dyn resulting of the compilation are copyed to the "bin" folder, while the lib files are copyed to the "lib" folder.
 
 2.3.- MAC
 
 The library has been tested on MAC. It can be build from the CMakeFiles.txt from the
